TODO:

***Make graph dynamically resizeable

***Store buffer lengths of x and y tick labels, so axes labels never collide with them

***create an SVG GROUP object that contains a vector of svgs.  On mouseover, the SVG GROUP will
activate the mouseover effects of each svg in the vector.  This will conveniently allow for multiple
svgs to interact with eachother, without creating a mouseover closure that involves all of them.
It will also allow for svg items to be added and removed just by putting them in / out of the group.

***make a gradient of sort for x and y axes to go along with "more conservative, more liberal" labels.  Maybe un-needed

***get more data so mouseover can properly fill out the info box on the side

***add confidence intervals to each point
