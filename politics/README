TODO:

DONE***Make graph dynamically resizeable

DONE***Store buffer lengths of x and y tick labels, so axes labels never collide with them

NEEDS MORE THOUGHT***create an SVG GROUP object that contains a vector of svgs.  On mouseover, the SVG GROUP will
activate the mouseover effects of each svg in the vector.  This will conveniently allow for multiple
svgs to interact with eachother, without creating a mouseover closure that involves all of them.
It will also allow for svg items to be added and removed just by putting them in / out of the group.

***make a gradient of sort for x and y axes to go along with "more conservative, more liberal" labels.  Maybe un-needed

***get more data so mouseover can properly fill out the info box on the side

***add confidence intervals to each point

***Add Search feature - "Find your senator" by name or by state

***INFORMATION POPUPS - for instance, mousing over "Conservative Rhetoric" could bring up a description saying something like
"Senators with a higher Speech Position more often use conservative vocabulary, like <GIVE EXAMPLES>

***People like comparisons.  Mousing over points gives that person's speech and vote values, but also gives a percentage or fraction showing how
they compare to others

***Decide how values will pop up- will they appear on axes, or on the side bar with everything else?

OPTIONS:
***Turn confidence intervals on or off

***Search or filter
